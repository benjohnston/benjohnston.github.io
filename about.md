I'm a designer, developer, strategist, and problem solver.

I'm fascinated by the art of solving problems with design. By the iterative process, the prototyping, and the decisions to be made. By the commonality between a mid-century household object and an application today. By the true 'how and why' behind the things we interact with, and what we can do to bring more value to the world. 

I've learned a lot over the past 9 years in the field, and have enjoyed it immensely. My goal is to never lose the curiosity; to continue to learn and grow on a daily basis, as both a human being, and as a designer building more accessible, valuable, modular, and performant systems.




### Product Design & Strategy  
  In addition to the usual product design objectives, I have specific experience in research, identification and balance of requirements, crafting and communicating big picture concepts, and rallying a team to create value for both the business and its fans. My background in development and test engineering is super helpful for rapid prototyping. 
 

### User Experience
 Research, iterative design, quick wireframes and FramerJS mockups, and high-fidelity JS/HTML/CSS prototyping. Most of my reading and [writing](http://onfriction.com) these days is on UX psychology, research, and next-gen/future-forward design.
 

### CSS
 Rework, SASS, Stylus, Myth, LESS. The actual preprocessor doesn't matter as much as the ability to build and maintain a modular architecture. I prefer SCSS syntax, but I have experience with them all. I'm a proponent of OOCSS in general, and prefer to design in the browser when it's appropriate.
 

### Javascript & HTML5
 I have given [several talks (slides)](https://www.polymer-project.org/) on Web Components and [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/), and am really looking forward to the future of client-side development. I'm familiar and comfortable in multiple libraries and frameworks, including (in no particular order) *React, Framer, Backbone, Lodash, jQuery, Angular, Handlebars, Node*, *Meteor*, *Ember*, and so on. I'm also a quick learner, and generally enjoy javascript.

### Ruby
 *Jekyll, Rails, Sinatra*, etc. and templating languages such as *Haml*, and especially *Liquid*. I still do quite a bit of my development and deployment tooling in Ruby, even though Gulp has largely taken over now — depending on the project.

### PHP
 Particularly: *ExpressionEngine*, *Wordpress*, *Drupal* (6, 7, and 8), and Magento. While it’s not in my go-to stack anymore, PHP was my bread and butter for years.

### Agile/Scrum
 Project & time management, measurement and estimation.
 

### Git collaboration 
And actually, SVN too, if that's your thing. Big fan of *gitflow*.
 

### Interdisciplinary communication
 Engineering can't always communicate well with Design, and sometimes neither can communicate well with Business development or Marketing.
