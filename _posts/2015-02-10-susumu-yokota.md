This whole record is just heavenly.

A lot of it revolves around ambience, but it's WAY too exciting of a listening experience to be pigeonholed as an 'ambient' album. It's wonderfully original, but I can hear influences like Kraftwerk, Eno/Budd, Moondog, Popol Vuh, Cluster, among others from delightfully different genres or fields; I mean, track 9 even features a Joni Mitchell sample.

I like how he downplays all kinds of super premium melodies by tucking them into chords or blending them to the background. And this same sort of juxtaposition exists in the broader concept of the album too; distinctly different shades and moods exist together within a single given song, but also between them.  

A couple of my favorite tracks: 

*Naminote* is like a beautiful Japanese scifi-jazz song sung by robots — sometimes I like to imagine/audiate the drum and piano tones as different slow attack synths from other songs like dreamy *Azukiiro No Kaori*. 

*Hagoromo* makes me accidentally meditate every time I hear it. Dat loop tho. So elegant. 

*Tobiume* is like the missing MDMA montage from Top Gun, and its spiritual sequel *Genshi* makes me want to do the most enthusiastic jumping jacks very quietly.

Definitely recommend listening on headphones or good speakers. Excellent for walks (especially aimless) or leisurely lounging (especially on a hammock or with a scenic mountain view).
