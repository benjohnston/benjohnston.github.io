        <p>
        I am currently accepting projects for UX, frontend engineering, test/QA engineering, growth engineering/strategy, and ocassionally full-stack MVP development (especially if it is collaborative), but my schedule does tend to fill up quickly. I don't book on a first-come/first-serve basis, and priority is not based on budget â€” I only work on products and ideas that I believe in.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Startups:</span> While I am a huge proponent of remote work, spending at least some time in-person is extremely valuable in MVP situations. I can conduct user research, or crank out code anywhere, but for things like design sprints, there's nothing like collaborating in-person with some coffee, a whiteboard, and notebooks. I am always happy to travel, even if it's not in your budget.
