Based on a hugely successful workshop, Picture Your Prosperity offers an interactive, enjoyable, motivating plan for women who want to take control of their finances and feel secure about the things that matter most to them.

The goal was to sell pre-orders. After many experiments and iterations — including 2 rounds of in-person user research — I designed and developed this as a custom Shopify theme. I really like how it turned out. Without the disorienting weight of typical ecommerce design, or the tackiness of information marketing, it is more like a series of tuned landing pages working together.
